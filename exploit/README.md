# fork canary

------

You can type the commmand `nc comp3632.firebird.sh 35990` to access the server which is executing this program.


**fork_canary.c**: the source code

**compile command**: gcc -m32 -z execstack -fstack-protector-all -no-pie -o fork_canary fork_canary.c

**fork_canary**: compiled executable file

There is a stack buffer overflow in this program, try to exploit this vulnerability to execute `getflag` function (which will read and output the flag)

*hint1: to write a exploit script, we recommend you to use python2 and the pwntools library to interact with executable. The link is here: [pwntools](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/)*

*hint2: to find the function address of `getflag` you may need IDA or other disassembly tools*

*hint3: processes that created by `fork` have the same memory layout, even the canary; the parent process would not crash when some children processes crash*
