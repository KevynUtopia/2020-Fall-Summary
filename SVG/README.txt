Thievies are the monsters and puppy is the player.
All UI are designed following the guideline of the PPT.
Monsters can only move vertically and would U-turn whenever hits the platform.
As vertical platform is moving up and down, monster might stuck when they meet each other. So I forbidden the monster to step into 
vertical platform's region(i.e U-turn before monster meet a vertical platform)

Otherwise, when player stand on the vertical platform, he can only jump when the platform reaches the lowest height 
as its status's been judged very frequently and vertical speed is been adjusted in high ferquency.


Need to mention that, the direction of SVG of monsters cannot be flipped. Though the direction of its bullets
are correct--shoot to right when moving to right. But I cannot transform its direction just like player
no matter how hard I tried. So I guess these 2 points could be deducted. (But please be awared that the direction
of monsters' bullets is correct, and flipping of player is also correct).

Each goodthing deserves 5 points, monster deserves 5 points, every level is Level*100 points and every second of rest time
deserves 1 point 

Bonus: additional feature: player can jump and kill the monster when he stamps on the monster
