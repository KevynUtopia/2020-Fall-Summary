# stream cipher

------

stream_cipher.py is used to generate the **key** file with the flag string from a secret file. Your task is to analyze the algorithm used in stream_cipher.py, and recover the flag from **key**.

(the flag looks like: flag{13579BDF0}, there is a 32-bit hex value inside brace)

(use python2)

flag{926201d7}
